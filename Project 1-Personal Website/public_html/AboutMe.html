<h2> Short bio: </h2>
<p style="align:center"> Howdy! My name is Olivia Ornelas and I am the loudest and the proudest member of Texas A&M’s class of 2022. 
Born and Raised in San Antonio, Texas, I decided to Major in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity and mathematics at Texas A&M University as a National Hispanic Recognition Scholar. At college, I joined SWElites freshman year. This freshman organization within Texas A&M University’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE) helped develop my professional development. 

<br></br>
In addition, I was a part of a 10-person team that planned and organized a Girls Scout event called STEMFest.
 This event was aimed for girls in elementary to middle school and showcased different engineering organizations performing quick experiments. 
 Sophomore year I became more involved with SWE by joining their SWEOutreach committee. 
 SWEOutreach aims to raise awareness about other discplines within engineering and break stigmas about STEM majors to K-12 students. </p>

 On this committee, I helped plan and demonstrate small engineering projects at a local elementary school twice a month. 
 In addition, a team of 10 people and I planned for another event similar to STEMFest but for high school students with harder STEM related challenges. 
 This event, called SWENext, was brand new to the Texas A&M chapter, so everyone on the team gained experience with recruiting, logistics, and planning the main schedule for this program. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this event had to be cancelled.
 <h3> Other than SWE </h3>
<p>
 In addition to joining a SWE committee, I began attending meetings for Texas A&M’s Cybersecurity club where I got to learn introductory concepts of Cybersecurity and further break down what that major consists of.
 From this club I learned the history of password hacking, and ways to mitigate this issue. During spring 2020, I joined the Aggie Coding Club. This club was created as a way for people in and outside of the Computer Science major to gain experience using various
coding skills and hear from different companies about their opportunities for computer science majors. 
<br></br>
In summer 2020, I got the opportunity to intern for the Air Force’s Communication and Information division. 
In this program, I gained hands on experience with working under leadership and presenting research I conducted while I interned.
