<h2> STEMfest</h2>
<p>
I was a part of a 10-person team that planned and organized a Girls Scout event called STEMfest.
 This event was aimed for girls in elementary to middle school and showcased different engineering organizations performing quick experiments. 
 </p>
 <h3> SWEOutreach Committee </h3>
 <p>
 SWEOutreach aims to raise awareness about other discplines within engineering and break stigmas about STEM majors to K-12 students.
 On this committee, I helped plan and demonstrate small engineering projects at a local elementary school twice a month. 
 In addition, a team of 10 people and I planned for another event similar to STEMFest but for high school students with harder STEM related challenges.

<h4> More </h4>
<p>
Along with being in SWE, freshman year I was a part of NSBE's outreach program, Technical Outreach Community Help (T.O.R.C.H). This program was similar to SWEOutreach, but went to a local Boys & Girls club instead of local elementary schools.
In addition to the outreach I've done, I would like to get more involved with my community by joining a service club and volunteering with them. In highschool, I volunteered
monthly with one of San Antonio's homeless shelters, Haven for Hope. While I was there I would serve and prep food or stock and sort Food bank items in the building's kitchen.
In college station, my college town, I would like to volunteer at an animal shelter or food bank in order to give back to the community I've been a part of for the past couple of years.
